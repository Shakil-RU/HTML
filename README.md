### [1.2 Tag, content, attribute, element]()

#### What is Tag & its syntax?

- Tag is the heart of html; HTML document is mainly built with tag.
- Tag Syntax: `<keyword>` ; Inside the angular brackets we need to write predefined keywords to use html tag.
- Small / capital letters both can be used when writing html tag; however small letter is prefered.
- Example: `<p> This is a paragraph </p>`
- In the example, `<p>` is an opening tag, `</p>` is a closing tag and `This is a paragraph` is called content
- In between the starting tag to end tag we have content
- Everything from starting tag to end tag is called Element

#### What are the types of Tag?

- There are 2 types of html tag: Pair/container tag and empty tag
- Pair tag has starting and ending; However, empty tag has no closing tag.
- Some of the example of pair tag and empty tags are given below:

  ```html
  <!-- Some examples of Pair/Container Tag -->
  <html>
    ...
  </html>
  <head>
    ...
  </head>

  </body>
  <p>...</p>
  <h1>...</h1>
  ....

  <!-- Some examples of Empty Tag -->
  <br />
  <hr />
  <img />
  <input />
  ...
  ```

#### What is attribute & how to use attribute?
